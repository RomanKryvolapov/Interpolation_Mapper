# Interpolation_Mapper
This is a value interpolation algorithm, it is made for Arduino Nano because it supports 5V, but you can use any other board. It is important to respect the bit depth of the input and output signal, or you need to add a conversion factor to the algorithm if the bit depth does not match.
